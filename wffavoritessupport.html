  <p>If you have questions, would like to contact the developer or inform the developer of an issue with the application, you can find instructions <a href="https://github.com/randycasburn/WFFavorites">here</a>.</p>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>Log in with your Weatherflow app credentials and be presented with your favorite list of wind via list and map. The app is configurable enough to meet any wind junkies needs. For example, it provides wind speed in Knots, MPH or KPH, the weather radar can be toggled on or off, etc.</p>
  <h2>Features:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Weatherflow account data, automatic data updates, weather radar</li>
    <li>Displays map with arrows showing direction and wind speed for each of your Weatherflow favorites.</li>
    <li>Displays a detailed or abbreviated quick-reference list of your favorite stations with current windspeed, direction, and temperature</li>
    <li>Arrows at the bottom allow quick navigation between each of the stations (forward or backward)</li>
    <li>Detail view provides available models shown on a familiar line chart - choose models you prefer
      <ul>
        <li>Scroll horizontally to see the entire chart</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Optionally provides approximately 1 hour past and 30 minutes future radar</li>
    <li>Data is updated in two ways:
      <ol>
        <li>Tap and hold the compass arrow at the bottom of the display</li>
        <li>The app automatically updates the data every 5 minutes</li>
      </ol>

    </li>
