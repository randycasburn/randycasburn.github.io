                <p>My agreement with WeatherFlow-Tempest precludes me from offering this app to the public.
                <br>Per that agreement, a few of my friends have been invited to install and use the app.</p>
                <h3>If you are interested in obtaining <strong>this</strong> app</h3>
                <p>Please advocate your interest to WeatherFlow-Tempest.

                    They may or may not respond. They have developed their own. You may find that you like their
                    approach more than what I've offered. Here is a screenshot of their current offering (as of mid 2025):

                   <div style="width: 200px; margin: 0 auto;"> <img height="150" src="images/ik-watch-screenshot.jpeg"/></div>

                    I don't think it is financially beneficial for them to develop and maintain an app like the one I've offered since the market is so tiny.
                    In an ideal world they would just allow me to do this.

                    WeatherFlow-Tempest, now just Tempest, provides a great service to the wind-sport enthusiast community.
                    You've probably noticed that <a href="https://weatherflow.com" target="_blank">weatherflow.com</a>
                    redirects to <a href="https://tempest.earth" target="_blank">tempest.earth</a>.
                    Like every company, Tempest has to make tough decisions about scarce resources.
                    That means some projects get higher priority than others. It's my feeling/impression that a
                    <a href="https://tempest.earth/personal-apps/" target="_blank">Personal Lifestyle App</a> specific
                    Apple Watch app falls into the delayed/scrapped project category.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They continue to update and improve the lifestyle web and mobile applications.
                    I think those will always be a top priority. After all, David St. John's (co-founder) <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stjohndavid/" target="_blank">Linked-In
                    profile</a> states:
                <blockquote>As an avid wind & water sportsman, my passion around creating better weather data was born of a selfish desire to get more time on the water (saving the world is just a bonus).</blockquote>

                                </p>
                <p>
                    I have been attempting to partner with them to make this app available to all of you for the same reasons David St. John started WeatherFlow in the first place.
                    The app represented here is a production ready, top quality, professionally engineered product.
                    It would require minimal effort and minimal risk on the part of Tempest to allow me to offer this publicly.
                    Their upside would be revenue sharing, brand enhancement and potential growth. Like all software products, risk can be controlled through trials. I can't think of the downside.
                    For business reasons I don't know or understand...(sigh) they refuse to even consider the idea.
                </p>
                <p>
                I have had a loose relationship with the company for more than 10 years.
                    They are great people and mean to continue to do great things for everyone who uses their products.
                </p>
                     <p>If you got this far...thanks for reading:<br>Randy Casburn</p>
