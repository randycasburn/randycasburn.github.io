                <p><strong>tldr;</strong> My agreement with WeatherFlow-Tempest precludes me from offering this app to the public.</p>
                <p>Per that agreement, a few of my friends have been invited to install and use the app.</p>
                <p>
                    WeatherFlow-Tempest, now just Tempest, provides a great service to the wind-sport enthusiast community.
                    The company seems to be laser focused on the capabilities the Tempest Weather Station provides to both Tempest and the consumer.
                    Unfortunately this also means their limited resources are not so focused on the Lifestyle apps that are important to wind-sport enthusiasts.
                    This is supported by the presence of a Tempest Weather Station support community and the lack of a Lifestyle App support Community. 
                    You've probably noticed that <a href="https://weatherflow.com" target="_blank">weatherflow.com</a> redirects to <a href="https://tempest.earth" target="_blank">tempest.earth</a>.
                    Like every company, Tempest has to make tough decisions about scarce resources. That means other projects are put on hold or scrapped altogether.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They haven't abandoned our needs as they continue to work hard to update and improve the lifestyle web and mobile applications.
                    I think those will always be a top priority. After all, David St. John's (co-founder) <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stjohndavid/" target="_blank">Linked-In
                    profile</a> states:
                <blockquote>As an avid wind & water sportsman, my passion around creating better weather data was born of a selfish desire to get more time on the water (saving the world is just a bonus).</blockquote>
                It's my feeling/impression that a <a href="https://tempest.earth/personal-apps/" target="_blank">Personal Lifestyle App</a> specific Apple Watch app falls into the delayed/scrapped category.
                It's fair to ask why I think that. The answer is they've been telling me for over a year that they are producing their own watch app.
                To be clear, we are not talking about a Tempest Weather Station watch app, we are talking about Personal Lifestyle Apps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have been attempting to partner with them to make this app available to all of you for the same reasons David St. John started WeatherFlow in the first place.
                    The app represented here is a production ready, top quality, professionally engineered product.
                    It would require minimal effort and minimal risk on the part of Tempest to allow me to offer this publicly.
                    Their upside would be revenue sharing, brand enhancement and potential growth. Like all software products, risk can be controlled through trials. I can't think of the downside (other than IT developer team arrogance).
                    For business reasons I don't know or understand...(sigh) they refuse to even consider the idea.
                </p>
                <p>
                I have had a loose relationship with the company for more than 10 years.
                    They are great people and mean to continue to do great things for everyone who uses their products.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>So I'm truly sorry I can't offer this to you.</strong> If you are interested in obtaining <strong>this</strong> app, please advocate your requirement to WeatherFlow-Tempest.
                    I recommend going to their <a href="https://help.tempest.earth/hc/en-us/requests/new" target="_blank">Contact WeatherFlow-Tempest</a> web form to make your request known.
